# Challenges -

- Creating different html files and Css styles made the styles overlap with each other and it took a long time to resolve, and to fix it I created a better foler structure and specified class and id names.

- Grid based contents were a bit of a challenge for me ti implement as they are to be kept consistent to have a better user experience.
